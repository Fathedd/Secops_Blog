About this blog


This blog documents my journey in the Security Realm. Offering both Technical and Shop talk.
I have been doing Security Operations for 11 years. Starting off with Blackhat operations when I was a lot younger.

Nowadays I ethically explore both Red and Blue team topics. Some in depth. Stick around, you may learn something or find a resource not previously known!

Languages: Rust, C/C++, ObjC, Swift, Python, Ruby, Solidity, Java, Javascript, Lisp
